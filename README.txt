	AVR Codebase v1.0
	
	This this codebase contains a lot of project source codes and other
	materials. Codes are mostly well documented, so that noobs might not
	get	it hard. Also the source codes comes with simulation file. 
	
	For any bug or new source code request on the next version of the 
	codebase, please contact jontropati@gmail.com
	
	Happy coding...
